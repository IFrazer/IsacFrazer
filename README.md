I'm Isac from Connecticut, and I'm an aspiring Cybersecurity Analyst/IT Professional. The reason I'm so passionate about the tech world and securing our data and integrity is because its important to me. I really enjoy reading the latest Tech and Cyber News on the Feedly app, keeps my mind fresh and up to date on whats going in the technology industry especially beacause we are going into a new era of everything technical.
